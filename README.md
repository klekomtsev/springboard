# Springboard - Data Science Bootcamp (in progress).

550+ hours of hands-on curriculum over 6-months timeline:

- 1:1 industry expert mentor oversight, 

- completion of 2 in-depth capstone projects. 

Mastering skills in Python, SQL, data analysis, data visualization, hypothesis testing, and machine learning.

## Capstone projects.

**capstone1/** -> data wrangling, data story and hypothesis testing for the first capstone project on the credit card defaults.

Machine learning for classification and feature selection: logistic regression, random forest, SVM, XGBoost, and voting classifier based on the above four.

Final report is available in capstone1/ folder.

## Mini - projects.

**data_wrangling_json/** -> data warangling using JSON files.

**sql_mini_project/** -> SQL: filtering, aggregating, joining.

**inferential_statistics_frequentist_mini_project/** -> frequentist statistical approach to analyze Sample Insurance Claim Prediction Dataset.

**bootstrap_inference_mini_project/** -> bootstrapping and permutation techniques for hypothesis testing on Sample Insurance Claim Prediction Dataset.

**bayesian_inference/** -> pymc3 module for bayesian inference on Sample Insurance Claim Prediction Dataset.

**linear_regression/** -> theory and applications of linear regression on Boston Housing Dataset.

**logistic_regression/** -> theory and applications of logistic regression for dual classification.

**clustering/** -> applying K-Means, Affinity propagation, Spectral, DBSCAN clustering and PCA on the dataset from John Foreman's book "Data Smart".  

**naive_bayes/** -> theory and applications of Naive Bayes for text classification using Rotten Tomatoes Dataset.

**pyspark_project/** -> Spark datasets and dataframes, Spark SQL, binary classifiaction models using Spark ML: linear regression, XGBoost, random forest. In application to "Adult dataset" from UCI repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult
