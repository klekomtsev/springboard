Title: Prediction of credit card defaults.

Objective: choose an optimal classification model allowing to calculate the probability of default and identify main predictors. Implement a full data science workflow: data wrangling, data story and preprocessing, identify important features, machine learning classifiers.

ML models: scikit-learn logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine with RBF kernel, XGBoost, voting classifier.
